## Team Member Bios
**Michael Wong:** I am currently enrolled in BCIT’s GIS Advanced Diploma Program and graduated with a BSc in environmental science from SFU. I most recently worked in the environmental consulting industry but decided to pivot into GIS as it was something that interested me during my undergrad and I enjoyed making maps and diagrams for environmental reports. As part of BCIT’s program, I am working on a project for a non profit conservation organization that involves conducting analyses on ecological observations located on or near the organizations conservation properties. I hope to continue to use GIS to work on environmentally related projects in the future. My hobbies include playing ice hockey and video games.

**Junior Thiensirisak:** I am currently a student at BCIT for the Advanced Diploma program with a BSc in Earth and Environmental Sciences from McMaster University. My background is mainly geology and business related however during my undergraduate studies, I stumbled upon GIS and decided that this was something I see myself doing as a career due to its diverse applications. Concurrently with my studies at BCIT, I'm working at a real estate company assisting with map creation and basic retail analysis. On my free time, I enjoy travelling to new places and playing video games with my friends.
